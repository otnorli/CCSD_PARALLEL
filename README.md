Big CCSD program. Very fast! Implemented brand new optimizations never before seen in the human world. 

Should be noted that it currently only works for even number of electrons, but we only need to add a few +1 and -1 around the code for it to work for odd number of electrons, no optimizations exclude odd number of electrons.

Eggstremely fast program, fastest in the world as far as I know and free to be downloaded by anyone! Feel free to use my code and make whatever changes you want. No need to ask permission. In fact please dont ask my permission.

ccsd_memory_optimized.cpp is the most optimal code. Rest of CCSD classes are stored versions of earlier and less effective code, in both speed and memory terms.

Program not 100% complete, still in the works. Simple minded version of CCSDTQ soon to be uploaded, also to be freely available.
